In the real world, it is a common phenomenon that multiple events existing in the same sentence, where extracting them are more difficult than extracting a single event. Previous works on modeling the associations between events by sequential modeling methods suffer a lot from the low efficiency in capturing very long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Jointly Multiple Events Extraction (JMEE) framework to jointly extract multiple event triggers and arguments by introducing syntactic shortcut arcs to enhance information flow and attention-based graph convolution networks to model graph information. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.","tags":[],"title":"Jointly Multiple Events Extraction via Attention-based Graph Information Aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhunchen Luo","Xiao Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527782400,"objectID":"5611a128b325de63a1b258c728762d84","permalink":"https://xiaoliubit.github.io/publication/coling2018-paperaccepted/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/coling2018-paperaccepted/","section":"publication","summary":"Twitter has become one of the most import channels to spread latest scholarly information because of its fast information spread speed. How to predict whether a scholarly tweet will be retweeted is a key task in understanding the message propagation within large user communities. Hence, we present the real-time scholarly retweeting prediction system that retrieves scholarly tweets which will be retweeted. First, we filter scholarly tweets from tracking a tweet stream. Then, we extract Tweet Scholar Blocks indicating metadata of papers. At last, we combine scholarly features with the Tweet Scholar Blocks to predict whether a scholarly tweet will be retweeted. Our system outperforms chosen baseline systems. Additionally, our system has the potential to predict scientific impact in real-time.","tags":[],"title":"Real-time Scholarly Retweeting Prediction System","type":"publication"}]
